# UNCOOKED - 2 Minute Presentation Script

## Opening (15 seconds)
"Hi everyone! We're excited to present **UNCOOKED** - a smart resume tailoring platform that helps job seekers stay authentic while optimizing their applications for specific roles."

---

## The Problem (20 seconds)
"Job seekers face a dilemma: generic resumes get rejected, but over-tailoring with AI makes you sound fake. Recruiters can spot AI-written content from a mile away, and it hurts your chances. You need to customize your resume for each job, but stay authentic - or 'uncooked' as we call it."

---

## The Solution (25 seconds)
"UNCOOKED solves this with AI-powered resume coaching. Instead of rewriting your resume, our system analyzes it against job descriptions and gives you a 'cookedness score' from 0 to 100. Lower is better - it means your resume is more authentic and less generic. We provide targeted suggestions to improve your content while keeping your unique voice."

---

## Tech Stack (20 seconds)
"Built with a modern full-stack architecture:
- **Frontend**: React with Vite for blazing-fast development and TipTap for rich text editing
- **Backend**: Django REST Framework with Python for robust API endpoints
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4 for intelligent resume analysis and suggestions
- **PDF Generation**: WeasyPrint for professional PDF exports
- All data persists to SQLite with full CRUD operations"

## Key Features - Demo (40 seconds)

### Feature 1: Job Tracking (10s)
"Let me show you the Home page - a comprehensive job application tracker. You can add jobs with all details: position, company, salary, deadlines, and follow-up dates. Everything persists to the database. You can sort, filter, and track status from 'Applying' to 'Accepted'. Notice our gradient navbar with the UNCOOKED branding."

### Feature 2: Master Resume (10s)
"Here's the Master Resume editor - a rich text editor where you create your base resume. Bold, italics, colors, bullet points - everything you need. This HTML content gets stored and serves as the foundation for all tailored versions."

### Feature 3: AI Tailoring (20s)
"The magic happens in Resume Tailor. For each job marked as 'Applying', click AI Tailor Resume. You can choose to build from your master resume OR from a previous company-specific resume - perfect for applying to multiple positions at the same company.

Our AI analyzes your resume against the job description and returns a cookedness score with specific suggestions. As you make changes, re-run the analysis to see your score improve. The goal: get as close to 0 as possible while keeping your authentic voice. When ready, export to PDF."

## Unique Value Proposition (10 seconds)
"Unlike generic AI resume builders, UNCOOKED coaches you to write better content yourself. It's not about automation - it's about authentic optimization. You stay in control, you stay genuine, you stay uncooked."

## Closing (10 seconds)
"UNCOOKED: helping job seekers craft compelling, authentic resumes that beat both ATS systems and human reviewers. Thank you!"
