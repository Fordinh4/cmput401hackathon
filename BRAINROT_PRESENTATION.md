# UNCOOKED - 2 Minute BRAINROT Presentation Script 🔥

## 🎬 THE ACT - Two Characters
**Person 1 (The Struggler)**: Desperate job seeker, visibly stressed
**Person 2 (The Cook/Savior)**: Cool, confident, has the solution

---

## Opening - THE STRUGGLE IS REAL (15 seconds)
**Person 1** *(frantically typing, looking at screen)*: 
"YO BRO I'VE BEEN SENDING OUT RESUMES FOR 3 MONTHS NO CAP! LinkedIn keeps saying '200 applicants' like... how am I supposed to compete?? 😭"

**Person 2** *(walks in casually)*: 
"Bruh... you're cooked. Literally. Let me show you how to stay UNCOOKED."

---

## The Problem - YOU'RE OVERCOOKED FAM (20 seconds)
**Person 1**: 
"What do you mean cooked??"

**Person 2**: 
"Look at this resume. 'Leveraged synergistic paradigms to optimize cross-functional deliverables'... BRO WHO TALKS LIKE THIS?? You used ChatGPT didn't you?"

**Person 1** *(guilty)*: 
"...maybe 👀"

**Person 2**: 
"THAT'S THE PROBLEM! You're either too generic or you sound like a robot. Recruiters can smell that AI slop from a MILE away. You gotta stay UNCOOKED - authentic but optimized. It's giving unemployed energy rn fr fr."

---

## The Solution - GET UNCOOKED (25 seconds)
**Person 2** *(pulls up laptop)*:
"Check this out - **UNCOOKED**. It's not just another AI resume writer. It's your personal resume COACH. We give you a 'cookedness score' from 0 to 100."

**Person 1**: 
"So like... lower is better?"

**Person 2**: 
"EXACTLY! 100 means you're OVERCOOKED - pure AI slop. 0 means you're RAW and AUTHENTIC - that's the goal! The AI analyzes your resume against job descriptions and tells you EXACTLY what's mid and what slaps. You fix it YOURSELF, stay genuine, and actually land interviews. We're literally helping you become that guy."

## Tech Stack - WE BUILT DIFFERENT (20 seconds)
**Person 1**: 
"Okay but like... how does it work?"

**Person 2** *(starts counting on fingers)*:
"Built with React and Vite cause we're not slow - instant load times, no cap. Django backend hitting those REST APIs CLEAN. OpenAI GPT-4 doing the big brain analysis. WeasyPrint making PDFs that actually look fire. And SQLite keeping ALL your data locked in - full CRUD operations baby! 

We're talking modern stack, scalable architecture, the whole nine yards. Bussin bussin! 💯"

## Demo Time - LET HIM COOK (40 seconds)

**Person 2**: 
"Alright check it - this is the Home page. You got your job tracker with ALL the deets..."

### Feature 1: Job Tracking (10s)
**Person 2** *(clicking around)*:
"Position, company, salary - yes we track the BAG 💰 - deadlines so you don't fumble, follow-up dates... You can even add tasks and check em off. Everything saves to the database so you never lose track. Sort by anything, filter by status - 'Applying', 'Interviewing', 'Accepted'... you know, manifesting that W."

### Feature 3: AI Tailoring (20s)
**Person 2** *(dramatically)*:
"BUT HERE'S WHERE THE MAGIC HAPPENS! Resume Tailor - pick a job, click 'AI Tailor Resume', and..."

**Person 1**: 
"YOOO IT'S ANALYZING IT!"

**Person 2**: 
"LOOK AT THAT - cookedness score: 78! That's COOKED! But check these suggestions... *reads suggestion* 'Instead of generic statements, highlight specific achievements with metrics'. 

You can even use a previous company resume as your base - applying to Google again? Start from your last Google resume! That's efficiency!

Make changes, re-run the analysis, watch that score DROP to like 25... now you're UNCOOKED! Export to PDF, send it off, and watch the interview requests roll in. It's giving employed era fr."

"So it's not just AI writing it for me?"

**Person 2**:

## Closing - THE FINAL BOSS (10 seconds)
**Person 2** *(points at camera)*:
